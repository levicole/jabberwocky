Jabberwocky is a jabber bot that I created to distribute links to the team at
change healthcare.  Right now it's just a spike, but it works.  I plan on
adding a web interface to display content pushed to the bot as well as an admin
interface for managing subscribers.  Sit tight, and check back for more.
